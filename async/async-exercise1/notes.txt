use setTimeOut to simulate an async function that returns back some data 

code as currently written will fail because the data is retrieved asynchronously
and can't be accessed because it returns back at a later point in time. 

loginUser and setTimeout return immediately, the email value that we want only returns after 2 seconds. 

Need to use a callback to retrieve the async value, 

show how we update the code to do this, we give loginUser a callback parm, and in our settimeout, 
we can invoke the callback once the email is retrieved, and we can pass the email to the callback. 

And then in our calling code, we can pass along an anonymous function as our callback, this anonymous function
takes in an email object, and we can then interact with the email object within our anonymouse function 


show how this works in the debugger, step through all the code via break points

Not all "bugs" will generate an error. Some are "logic" bugs
aka the program doesn't fail but does the wrong thing

Show equality problem. Use === to compare. Strict equality. Compares both value and type.  

Use this as an opportunity to show that you can use the console to test 

Examples:
1 === 1   // true
1 == '1'  // true
1 === '1' // false

- reason this happens is because will attempt to coerce values of different types for certain operations
- when checking equality, javascript will attempt to coerce non numeric types into numbers 

what about:
'true' == true    // false 
'false' == false  // false 
'0' == false      // true 
[] === [] // false 

- js doesn't know try to coerce to boolean, it attempt to coerce 'false' to number, but can't 
- '0' javascript will coerce this to 0, 0 is equivalent to false 
- reference, they're different arrays 

'0' === false     // false 


numeric operations: 
1 + 2   // 3
"1" + 2   // 12 
"1" + "2" // 12 
1+2+"3"   // 33
 "1"+"2"+3    // 123



'+' triggers implicit conversion to string 
'==' triggers implicit number conversion
